JQueryVAngularVReact
====================

A simple project that achieves the same goal using simple JQuery, AngularJS and ReactJS

It uses a simple web server created using node.js and express to serve up dummy data for use in the examples.

Before you start you must have node.js installed.
Then from the root of the project, type:
```
npm install express
```

This does what is says on the tin.

Finally, you can run the mock server using:
```
node mockServer.js
```

From your browser go to the following page:
```
localhost:3000
```
